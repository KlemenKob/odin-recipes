        <h2>What is omelette?</h2>
    </p>
    <p> 
        <p>In cuisine, an omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from beaten eggs,</p>
        <p>fried with butter or oil in a frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg).</p>
        <p>It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives,</p>
        <p>vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination</p>
        <p>of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk,</p> 
        <p>cream, or water.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp butter</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper.</p> 
                <p>Heat the oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over</p>
                    <p>a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from </p>
                <p>one side to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface </p>
                    <p>of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds </p>
                        <p>then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.</p></li>
            <li><p>Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the </p>
                <p>runny egg. Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.</p></li>
            <li><p>At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like</p>
                <p> – some grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, sautéed mushrooms</p>
                    <p> or smoked salmon all work well. Scatter the filling</p> 
                        <p>over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with</p> 
                            <p>the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.</p></li>
