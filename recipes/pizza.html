        <h2>What is pizza?</h2>
    </p>
        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, </p>
        <p>flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,</p> 
        <p>and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage,</p>
        <p> anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.),</p>
        <p>which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups warm water (600 mL)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>7 cups all-purpose flour (875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup semolina flour (30 g)</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaf</li>
            <li>olive</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast</p>
                <p>in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles</p>
                <p>  form on the surface.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in</p>
                <p> the middle and add the olive oil</p> 
                    <p>and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a</p> 
                        <p>shaggy dough begins to form.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a</p> 
                <p>clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes.</p>
                <p>The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy.</p> 
                    <p>Form the dough into a taut round.</p></li>
            <li><p>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough</p>
                <p>inside, turning to coat with the</p>
                    <p>oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at</p> 
                        <p>least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</p></li>
            <li><p>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work</p> 
                <p>surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal</p> 
                    <p>portions and shape into rounds.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest</p>
                <p>for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any</p> 
                    <p>other ingredients.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F </p>
                <p>(230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down</p> 
                    <p>so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes</p> 
                <p>and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food</p> 
                    <p>processor, and puree until smooth.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the</p> 
                <p>surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.</p></li>
            <li><p>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner</p> 
                <p>than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up</p> 
                    <p>during baking.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched</p>
                <p>crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes,</p>
                <p>or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</p></li>
            <li>Add any garnish of your preference.</li>
